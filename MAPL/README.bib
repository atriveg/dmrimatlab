This module is a free implementation for the Mean Apparent Propagator MRI (MAP-MRI) described
by Ozarslan and colleagues:

Ozarslan E, Koay CG, Shepherd TM, Komlosh ME, Irfanoglu MO, Pierpaoli C, Basser PJ.
Mean apparent propagator (MAP) MRI: a novel diffusion imaging method for mapping
tissue microstructure. Neuroimage 78:16-32. Elsevier, 2013.

It is based on the implementation suggested by Fick and colleagues, where a penalty term
for the energy of the Laplacian is used for regularization:

Fick RHJ, Wassermann D, Caruyer E, Deriche R. MAPL. Tissue microstructure estimation
using Laplacian-regularized MAP-MRI and its application to HCP data.
Neuroimage 134:365-385. Elsevier, 2016.

The anisotropic weighting based on DTI estimation described by Ozarslan is used. Besides,
the problem is stated as a quadratic programming one, i.e. both positivity constraints over
the EAP and a unit-mass equality constraint are imposed.

NOTE: This module is not aimed at mimicking the behavior of the MAP-MRI/MAPL implementation
within Python's dipy module. For example, in our code the positivity constraints are imposed
over a Cartesian grid defined in the normalized EAP space, instead of a spherical grid on
the domain of the attenuation signal E(q). We use a custom quadratic programming routine,
which does not depend on CVX or other third parties. Finally, in case Generalized Cross
Validation (GCV) is used, the (exhaustive) search is perfomed in the logarithmic domain of
the regularization parameter.

We have checked our implementation to be acceptably fast/accurate up to a maximum Nmax = 6
with >650 constraints for HCP-MGH data (shells up to 5,000 s/mm^2).
