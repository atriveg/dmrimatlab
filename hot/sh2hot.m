% function [HOT,A] = sh2hot( SH, 'opt1', value1, 'opt2', value2, ... )
%
%   Computes the (unique) components of a hyper-symmetric, higher order
%   tensor of rank L from the SH expansion of a signal up to order L.
%
%      SH: a MxNxPx((L+1)(L+2)/2) double array containing the coefficients
%         of the spherical harmonics expansion at each voxel. Note L is
%         even, and the fourth dimension of this array must match a proper
%         size.
%      HOT: a MxNxPx((L+1)(L+2)/2) double array containing the unique 
%         coefficients of the equivalent HOT representation.
%      A: if a second output is requested, A is the conversion matrix
%         leading from SH to HOT (Size KxK, for K=(L+1)(L+2)/2).
%
%   For an order L, the rank-L HOT represetation is the sum of
%   K=(L+1)(L+2)/2 terms:
%
%
%      S(x,y,z) = sum_k T(k)*mu(k)*x^nx(k)*y^ny(k)*z^nz(k)
%               = T(1)*mu(1)*x^L*y^0*z^0 + ...
%               + T(2)*mu(2)*x^{L-1}*y^1*z^0 + ...
%               + T(3)*mu(3)*x^{L-2}*y^2*z^0 + ...
%               ...
%               + T(L)*mu(L)*x^{0}*y^L*z^0 + ...
%               + T(L+1)*mu(L+1)*x^{L-1}*y^0*z^1 + ...
%               ...
%               + T(K)*mu(K)*x^0*y^0*z^L + ...
%
%   where mu(k) are the multiplicities of each unique component of the HOT
%   and nx+ny+nz=L.

%   Optional arguments may be passed as name/value pairs in the regular
%   matlab style:
%
%      mask: a MxNxP array of logicals. Only those voxels where mask is
%         true are processed, the others are filled with zeros.
%      maxthreads: ONLY IN POSIX SYSTEMS the algorithm is run with
%         multiple threads. This is the maximum allowed number of threads,
%         which can indeed be reduced if it exceeds the number of logical
%         cores (default: the number of logical cores in the machine).
